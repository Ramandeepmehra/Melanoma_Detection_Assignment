# Melanoma Detection Assignment

> This assignment involves building a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow. CNNs are particularly suited for image classification tasks. The process includes defining the network architecture, compiling the model, training it on data, and evaluating its performance. The assignment provides an opportunity to learn how to build, train, and evaluate a custom CNN in TensorFlow, gaining valuable experience in deep learning and image classification.

> **Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.**

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

* Actinic keratosis
* Basal cell carcinoma
* Dermatofibroma
* Melanoma
* Nevus
* Pigmented benign keratosis
* Seborrheic keratosis
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Vascular lesion
 


## General Information

* Build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture in TensorFlow.
* Design and implement a CNN architecture tailored to the specific dataset.
* Familiarize yourself with the problem statement and the dataset.
* Incorporate max-pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while preserving essential information.
* Use a stack of fully connected layers to combine the high-level features extracted by the convolutional layers and make the final classification decision.
* Train your custom CNN model using TensorFlow's built-in optimization algorithms, such as Adam or SGD.
* Choose a loss function appropriate for multiclass classification, such as cross-entropy loss.
* Use regularization techniques, like dropout or batch normalization, to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of your model.
* Evaluate the performance of your CNN model using common metrics for multiclass classification, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Fine-tune your model's hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art results on your chosen dataset.


## Conclusions

* The overarching goal is to support efforts to reduce deaths caused by skin cancer.
* The primary motivation is to use advanced image classification technology for people's well-being.
* Computer vision has made significant progress in machine learning and deep learning, which are scalable across domains.
* The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
* All images were sorted according to the ISIC classification, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images.
